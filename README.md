# ðŸŒ± Basic Web Projects

This is a collection of my basic web development projects, created as I learn and grow in HTML and CSS.

Most of these are simple or experimental and may not serve any practical use â€” for now. But they help me track my progress and creativity.

## ðŸ“Œ What to Expect

* Simple HTML/CSS pages
* Practice layouts (using Flexbox, Grid, etc.)
* **Some are responsive**, while **some are not (yet)**
* Experiments with responsiveness and creative styling
* Occasional useful mini-projects (eventually!)
* This repository will be updated regularly as I learn more

Consider this my frontend sandbox! ðŸ§ª

## ðŸ›  Tech Used (so far)

* HTML5
* CSS3
* *(JavaScript will come later as I learn it â€” for now, Iâ€™m focused on solidifying the basics.)*

## ðŸ“– Notes

* These projects are **not production-ready**
* Built purely for **practice, learning, and personal milestones**
* Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!

---

## ðŸš€ Future Goals

* Add interactive elements using JavaScript
* Create more polished and useful mini-projects
* Improve UI/UX and responsiveness
* Eventually build a portfolio site using these foundations
