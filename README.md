# ðŸŒ± Basic Web Projects

This is a collection of my basic web development projects, created as I learn and grow in HTML and CSS.  
Most of these are simple or experimental and may not serve any practical use â€” for now. But they help me track my progress and creativity.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What to Expect

- Simple HTML/CSS pages  
- Practice layouts (using Flexbox, Grid, etc.)  
- Experiments with responsiveness and styling  
- Some creative or fun ideas  
- Occasional useful mini-projects (eventually!)  

Iâ€™ll keep updating this repository throughout my learning journey â€” consider this my frontend sandbox! ðŸ§ª

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Used (so far)

- HTML5  
- CSS3  

JavaScript will come later as I learn it. For now, Iâ€™m focusing on solid basics.

---

## ðŸ“– Notes

None of the projects here are production-ready or built for real use. Theyâ€™re just for practice, learning, and personal milestones.

---

## ðŸš€ Future Goals

- Add interactive elements using JavaScript  
- Create more useful and polished mini-projects  
- Improve UI/UX and responsiveness  
- Possibly build a portfolio site using these foundations
